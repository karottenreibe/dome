# Dome #

This is [Dome], a pure Ruby HTML DOM parser with CSS3 support.


## Features ##

Dome features a **HTML DOM parser** (i.e. it generate a tree structure
from the HTML document) that supports common HTML/XML including
namespaces and HTML comments. It is designed to never abort parsing
due to errors and will instead try to fix the errors.

It also features an implementation of **CSS3 selectors** to traverse a
DOM tree and grab elements from it, although it [diverges a bit] [cssdiv]
from the standard in some points.

Furthermore it has a **Scraper** class that allows for easy extraction of
arbitrary data from HTML documents with very little code overhead.
